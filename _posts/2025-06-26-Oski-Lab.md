# SCENARIO

The accountant at the company received an email titled "Urgent New Order" from a client late in the afternoon. When he attempted to access the attached invoice, he discovered it contained false order information. Subsequently, the SIEM solution generated an alert regarding downloading a potentially malicious file. Upon initial investigation, it was found that the PPT file might be responsible for this download. Could you please conduct a detailed examination of this file?

## Question ONE 
Determining the creation time of the malware can provide insights into its origin. What was the time of malware creation?

So I headed to VirusTotal and uploaded the malicious PPT file hash.
Then I went to the "Details" tab and scrolled down to find the "Creation Time" under the File metadata section.

This indicates when the malware file was first created on disk. It helps correlate the timing with possible campaigns or attacker activity windows.

## Question TWO

# Identifying the command and control (C2) server that the malware communicates with can help trace back to the attacker. Which C2 server does the malware in the PPT file communicate with?

Command and Control (C2C) servers are critical components of many malware operations, acting as the central hub where an attacker can remotely control infected systems. Once a system is compromised, the malware establishes a connection with the C2C server to receive instructions, such as data exfiltration commands, additional payloads, or further malicious activities. Understanding and identifying the C2C server involved in a malware campaign is vital for tracing back to the attacker, disrupting communication channels, and mitigating further damage.

1. In VirusTotal, check **Relations â†’ Contacted URLs** and pivot to community comments.
2. Youâ€™ll spot a `.php` endpoint.
