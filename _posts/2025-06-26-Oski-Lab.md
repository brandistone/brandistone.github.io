# SCENARIO

The accountant at the company received an email titled "Urgent New Order" from a client late in the afternoon. When he attempted to access the attached invoice, he discovered it contained false order information. Subsequently, the SIEM solution generated an alert regarding downloading a potentially malicious file. Upon initial investigation, it was found that the PPT file might be responsible for this download. Could you please conduct a detailed examination of this file?

## Question ONE 
Determining the creation time of the malware can provide insights into its origin. What was the time of malware creation?

So I headed to VirusTotal and uploaded the malicious PPT file hash.
Then I went to the "Details" tab and scrolled down to find the "Creation Time" under the File metadata section.

ðŸ“Œ Answer: 2023-10-29 13:14:37

This indicates when the malware file was first created on disk. It helps correlate the timing with possible campaigns or attacker activity windows.

## Question TWO

**Identifying the command and control (C2) server that the malware communicates with can help trace back to the attacker. Which C2 server does the malware in the PPT file communicate with?**

Command and Control (C2C) servers are critical components of many malware operations, acting as the central hub where an attacker can remotely control infected systems. Once a system is compromised, the malware establishes a connection with the C2C server to receive instructions, such as data exfiltration commands, additional payloads, or further malicious activities. Understanding and identifying the C2C server involved in a malware campaign is vital for tracing back to the attacker, disrupting communication channels, and mitigating further damage.

1. In VirusTotal, check **Relations â†’ Contacted URLs** and pivot to community comments.
2. Youâ€™ll spot a `.php` endpoint.

## Question THREE

**Identifying the initial actions of the malware post-infection can provide insights into its primary objectives. What is the first library that the malware requests post-infection?**

Analyzing a malwareâ€™s initial behavior after infection is crucial for revealing its underlying goals and operational patterns. These early actions frequently involve the loading of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) or initiating outbound connections to command and control (C2) servers. Such steps are often indicative of attempts to establish persistence, execute core payloads, or collect host environment data. Observing these first-stage behaviors offers critical insight into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the malware employs.

Go to Behaviour -> dropped files the first dll file
ðŸ“Œ Answer: sqlite3.dll

## Question FOUR 
**By examining the provided Any.run report, what RC4 key is used by the malware to decrypt its base64-encoded string?**

I headed to the site provided and looked for the RC4 key.

You might be wobdering what a RC4 key is ðŸ˜ƒ. **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)** is a symmetric stream cipher that encrypts data byte by byte using a pseudorandom keystream XORâ€™d with the plaintext. In malware, RC4 is commonly used to encrypt strings, payloads, or configuration data to evade detection and hinder analysis.

**Malware configuration** consists of embedded settings that define the malwareâ€™s behavior, such as encryption keys, C2 server addresses, and execution commands. Analyzing these configurations helps researchers understand the malwareâ€™s functionality, communication patterns, and potential targets.

## Question FIVE 
**By examining the MITRE ATT&CK techniques displayed in the Any.run sandbox report, identify the main MITRE technique (not sub-techniques) the malware uses to steal the userâ€™s password.**

Go to the provided link and look for the MITRE button and press it

ðŸ“Œ Answer: T1555

## Question SIX

**By examining the child processes displayed in the Any.run sandbox report, which directory does the malware target for the deletion of all DLL files?**

![](/assets/images/posts/oski5.jpg)

Malware often deletes files to cover its tracks. Analyze the process tree for any commands that attempt to delete files post-execution.

ðŸ“Œ Answer: C:\ProgramData

## Question SEVEN

**Understanding the malware's behavior post-data exfiltration can give insights into its evasion techniques. By analyzing the child processes, after successfully exfiltrating the user's data, how many seconds does it take for the malware to self-delete?**
