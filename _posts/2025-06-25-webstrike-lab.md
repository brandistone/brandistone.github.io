*SCENARIO*

A suspicious file was identified on a company web server, raising alarms within the intranet. The Development team flagged the anomaly, suspecting potential malicious activity. To address the issue, the network team captured critical network traffic and prepared a PCAP file for review.
Your task is to analyze the provided PCAP file to uncover how the file appeared and determine the extent of any unauthorized activity.

üîç Step-by-Step Analysis:

Question 1
Identifying the geographical origin of the attack facilitates the implementation of geo-blocking measures and the analysis of threat intelligence. From which city did the attack originate?

üí° Note: The lab machines do not have internet access. To look up the IP address and complete this step, use an IP geolocation service on your local computer outside the lab environment.
